# MLB 2020 Win Totals
Predicting how many wins each team will win in 2020. We will upload data taken from the web from the past “however many needed” years to find trends and specific statistics that led to wins. We will take those trends/statistics in order to predict how many games each team will win. We will use Python Pandas to load and clean the data from the web. We will use Tableau to show visualizations.

# Getting Started
Found and imported data via .csv from fangraphs.com. Had to narrow down which stats categories contributed the most to individual wins for teams. From the pitching perspective it was team earned run average, strikeouts, and hits allowed. From the offensive perspective it was homeruns, strikeouts, and batting average.
# Training and Testing
Plugging these specific team stats into our training and testing model. Once we fitted the model the overall score ended up being 0.8279314879863826. Which isn't perfect but this shows that these specific team stats can be predictive in how many wins each team gets. We assigned each team with a unique team id which the model showed how many wins for each unique team. This is what we used for our predictions.
# Visualization
We then took this data and imported it into Tableau for some great and in depth visualizations to show our research.
