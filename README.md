# MLB 2020 Win Totals
Predicting how many wins each team will win in 2020. We will upload data taken from the web from the past “however many needed” years to find trends and specific statistics that led to wins. We will take those trends/statistics in order to predict how many games each team will win. We will use Python Pandas to load and clean the data from the web. We will use Tableau to show visualizations.
